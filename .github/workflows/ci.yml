# GitHub Actions CI — runs automatically on every push and pull request.
#
# WHAT IS CI (Continuous Integration)?
#   CI is an automated process that runs your tests and linting checks every
#   time code is pushed to GitHub. If tests fail or the linter finds issues,
#   you get notified before the broken code reaches the main branch.
#
# WHAT IS GITHUB ACTIONS?
#   GitHub's built-in CI/CD service. This YAML file tells GitHub: "Every time
#   someone pushes code or opens a PR, spin up a fresh Linux machine, install
#   Python, install our dependencies, and run our tests + linter."
#
# HOW TO READ THIS FILE:
#   - `on:` = what triggers this workflow (push, pull request)
#   - `jobs:` = the tasks to run (we have two: lint and test)
#   - `steps:` = the ordered steps within each task
#   - `uses:` = pre-built actions from the GitHub marketplace
#   - `run:` = shell commands to execute
