We're wrapping up for now. Do the following:

1. Read the current PUPPETSTRING_PROJECT_PLAN.md
2. Update the "Project Status & Session Log" section — add a new session entry with today's date, what was accomplished, and what to pick up next
3. Update any Phase checklist items that were completed this session (change `[ ]` to `[x]`)
4. Commit the updated plan file with a message like "docs: update session log and progress"
5. Show me a brief summary of what we got done
