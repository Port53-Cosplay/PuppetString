We're wrapping up for now. Do the following:

1. **Run the environment health check first.** Read and execute the checks from `scripts/health_check.py` mentally — verify that all core modules can be imported by attempting to import `puppetstring`, `puppetstring.cli`, `puppetstring.config`, `puppetstring.core.models`, and `puppetstring.modules.prompt_injection`. If any import would fail (e.g., the editable install points to a deleted directory), STOP and flag the issue to the user before continuing. Do NOT skip this step.

2. Read the current PUPPETSTRING_PROJECT_PLAN.md

3. Update the "Project Status & Session Log" section — add a new session entry with today's date, what was accomplished, and what to pick up next

4. Update any Phase checklist items that were completed this session (change `[ ]` to `[x]`)

5. Commit the updated plan file with a message like "docs: update session log and progress"

6. Show me a brief summary of what we got done
