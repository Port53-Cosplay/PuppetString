Read the PUPPETSTRING_PROJECT_PLAN.md file, specifically the "Project Status & Session Log" section and the Phase checklists. Summarize:

1. What phase we're currently in
2. What's been completed (checked items)
3. What's next to work on (first unchecked items)
4. Any blockers or notes from previous sessions

Keep it brief — just the actionable summary.
