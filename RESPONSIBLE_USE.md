# Responsible Use Policy

PuppetString is a security testing tool designed to help organizations identify and fix vulnerabilities in their AI agent deployments.

## This Tool Is NOT For

- Attacking systems you don't own or have authorization to test
- Creating weapons or malware
- Bypassing security controls on production systems without authorization
- Any illegal activity

## Rules of Engagement

1. **Authorization Required.** Only use PuppetString against systems you own or have explicit written authorization to test.

2. **Controlled Environments First.** We strongly recommend testing against the included vulnerable test targets (`puppetstring stage up`) before running against any real system.

3. **No Production Without Approval.** Never run PuppetString against production AI agents without approval from the system owner and appropriate stakeholders.

4. **Responsible Disclosure.** If you discover a vulnerability in a third-party AI agent or MCP server using PuppetString, follow responsible disclosure practices. Contact the vendor privately and give them reasonable time to fix the issue before any public disclosure.

5. **Data Handling.** PuppetString may capture sensitive data during testing (system prompts, tool configurations, conversation logs). Handle this data according to your organization's data classification policies.

## Legal Disclaimer

PuppetString is provided "as-is" for authorized security testing purposes only. The authors are not responsible for misuse of this tool. Users are solely responsible for ensuring their use complies with all applicable laws and regulations.
